      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Mark Zuckerberg's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1984</strong> - Born in White Plains, New York, the only son of a dentist and psychiatrist (he has three sisters).</li>
        <li>
          <strong> 2002</strong> - Graduates from Phillips Exeter Academy, a private school in New Hampshire; 
          joins Harvard University in autumn on a psychology and computer science course.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2004</strong> - Starts Thefacebook.com in February. Drops out of Harvard at the end of his sophomore year; 
          moves to Palo Alto that summer, where he rents a house with a now-famous swimming pool (and zip-wire).
  
          Later this year, Facebook hits 200,000 users; contacts venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, and receives an initial investment of half a million dollars - some of which is used to splash out on a small office above a Chinese restaurant.
          
          The Winklevoss twins file a lawsuit against Zuckerberg claiming he ripped off their idea for a new social network, HarvardConnection (later ConnectU).

          <strong>2007</strong> -Opens Facebook beyond universities so anyone with an email address can join; turns down a $15 billion offer from Microsoft, which would have bagged him personally $4 billion.
